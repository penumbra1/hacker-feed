[How to GraphQL](https://www.howtographql.com/react-apollo/) front-end tutorial project.

Final code can be found [here](https://github.com/howtographql/react-apollo), but I'm planning a few changes:

1. Move Prisma secret to .env ✔️
2. Experiment with Tachyons, clean up the markup ✔️ (WIP)
3. Avoid storing JWT in localstorage
4. Add comments and user dashboard with posts
